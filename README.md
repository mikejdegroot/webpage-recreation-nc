### Newcross Webpage recreation

Notes

- You must have gulp CLI installed globally, it is compiling the SCSS
- Download the repo and type 'npm i' to download the packages


Extra things

- A simple regex controls the validations of the form, and is hidden when the input is correct and resubmitted


Future thoughts
- Some of the spacing and lettering is a bit off when the browser window is resized (rather than using the mobile chrome tool), if I had more time I would look into polishing this up a bit.


Thats it, thank you!
